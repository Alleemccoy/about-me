    <p>
      Hi there, My name is Allee McCoy, I was born in California and raised in Washington state. I come from a mixed family where my mom is Caucasian and my father is Samoan-American, to complete my family picture I have two younger sisters who are twins and the youngest is my brother. Within the last five years I have achieved holding the title of #1 Life Insurance Agent within the company surpassing over 1 million dollars in sales to now managing Microsoft's speaker training program on a global scale. In addition to my fulltime job as a Speaker Specialist at Microsoft I am attending Code Fellows in Seattle, WA to become a software developer. My hobbies include traveling, creating memories with family and friends, event planning, playing volleyball, watching competitive sports, anything adventurous and more!
